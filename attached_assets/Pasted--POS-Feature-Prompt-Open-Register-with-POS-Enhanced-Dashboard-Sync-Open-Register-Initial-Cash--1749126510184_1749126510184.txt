[ Submit ]                    ← (Button to open register)
Backend Action:

📊 POS-Enhanced Dashboard (After Register is Open)
Once the register is opened, the dashboard reflects real-time financial activity for the day.

🖥️ POS Dashboard UI – Section 1: Register Summary
Label	Value

Cash In Hand	₹1000.00
Opened At	9:00 AM
Opened By	Cashier 1

💳 Section 2: Real-Time Sales Overview

Cash Sales	₹2000.00

💵 Section 3: Live Cash Tracker

Edit
Cash In Drawer = Opening Cash + Cash Sales + UPI Sales - Withdrawals
               = ₹1000 + ₹2000 + ₹1500 - ₹500
               = ₹4000.00
This reflects the actual cash that should currently be in the drawer.

📦 Backend Logic Requirements
Create a POST /open_register endpoint:

Accepts opening_cash, user_id, timestamp.

Creates a new register session with status: open.

All sales throughout the day should link to the active register_id.

Provide a /dashboard_summary endpoint:

Returns real-time data from sales, refunds, and withdrawals filtered by the current open register.

Update cash_in_hand dynamically with each transaction:

Cash/UPI sale increases it

Withdrawal/refund decreases it

🎯 Final Goal
✅ Start the day by opening the register with base cash
✅ Real-time sales tracking connected to current session
✅ Dynamic, accurate “Cash In Drawer” visibility
✅ Supports multiple payment modes (Cash, UPI, Others)
