 What's Working:
You're successfully recording payments from the Bill Payment Management section.

The payment of ‚Çπ100 is recorded, and the confirmation popup shows:
"Payment of ‚Çπ100 recorded via Cash. Remaining balance: ‚Çπ76."

‚ùå Issue:
Despite successful payment recording:

The Payment Status in the Purchase Dashboard still shows:

Payment Due ‚Çπ176 (instead of updating to ‚Çπ76 due).

The Record Payment button still appears as if no payment was made.

üîç Likely Causes:
This is most likely a frontend not refreshing / syncing issue, or backend not reflecting partial payments correctly. Some possible technical reasons:

Payment recorded in database but not reflected in UI:

Dashboard data might be cached or not reloaded after payment.

Payment logic in dashboard only checks for "fully paid":

If Amount Paid < Grand Total, status might still show as "Payment Due" instead of "Partially Paid".

No trigger to refresh dashboard state after payment entry:

After recording, the dashboard doesn‚Äôt fetch the updated payment info automatically.

‚úÖ What You Should Check / Fix in Code:
1. Ensure Payment Status Logic Covers Partial Payments
In your code, wherever you calculate payment status, confirm it includes:

js
Copy
Edit
if (amount_paid === total_amount) {
  status = "Fully Paid";
} else if (amount_paid > 0) {
  status = "Partially Paid";
} else {
  status = "Payment Due";
}
Your current logic might only be checking for amount_paid == total_amount.

2. Force Dashboard to Refresh After Payment
After payment is recorded, trigger a refresh of the dashboard or refetch of payment data.

js
Copy
Edit
await refreshPurchaseOrders(); // or similar method
3. Check the Database for Payment Updates
Ensure the payment record is properly inserted and associated with the correct purchase_order_id.

Also verify that the amount_paid is being updated in the purchase order record.

4. Add a Status Update Function
On payment entry, update the purchase order status:

js
Copy
Edit
updatePurchaseOrderStatus(orderId, newStatus);
‚úÖ Suggestion for UI Improvement:
Add a "Partially Paid" label (with orange or yellow color) for clarity in the dashboard.

‚úÖ Verification Step:
You can confirm the backend is working fine by:

Opening the individual purchase order page after recording payment.

See if "Amount Paid" reflects ‚Çπ100 and "Balance Due" ‚Çπ76.

If yes, then the backend is correct ‚Äî it's a frontend update/display issue.
