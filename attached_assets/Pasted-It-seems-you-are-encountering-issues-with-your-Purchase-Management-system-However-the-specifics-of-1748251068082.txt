It seems you are encountering issues with your Purchase Management system. However, the specifics of the issue were not stated. Here are some general steps you can follow to troubleshoot common problems:

Check Database Connections: Ensure that your database connection is established correctly and that the schema is up to date. You recently modified the purchase_items schema, so make sure all columns are populated and accessed properly.

Validate API Endpoints: If your application is not displaying or saving data, ensure that the API endpoints for fetching and saving purchases are working correctly. You can add some console.log statements or use debugging tools to check the responses.

Handle State Changes Properly: If you're using state management (like React's useState), double-check that your state updates are happening as expected after data mutations.

User Interface Updates: Confirm that the UI is correctly updated after adding or editing purchases. Make sure that the component is re-rendering when state changes occur.

Check Error Handling: Look at error logs during operations. Enhance your functions with error handling to catch any potential failures during API calls or database transactions.

If you can specify the particular aspect that isn't working correctly (e.g., saving data, displaying data, etc.), I can provide more targeted assistance.

It looks like you want to proceed with some fixes or enhancements for your Purchase Management system. Here are some suggestions to address the issues you're experiencing:

1. Display Data in Edit Mode
Make sure the data for the items you're trying to edit is correctly fetched and passed to your edit component. Check that the API endpoint for fetching purchase details is returning the expected data.

2. Add Data in Purchase Management
Ensure that your form submission for adding new purchases is properly sending the data to the server. It might be good to validate that your API handles POST requests correctly and check the frontend logic that handles the submission.

Hereâ€™s an example of how the purchase-entry-professional.tsx file might look to handle adding new data:

import { useState } from 'react';
import { useMutation } from 'react-query';
import { apiRequest } from '../lib/queryClient'; // Ensure this is correctly imported
const PurchaseEntryProfessional = () => {
  const [purchaseData, setPurchaseData] = useState({
    productId: '',
    quantity: 0,
    // other fields...
  });
  const addPurchase = useMutation(async () => {
    const response = await apiRequest('POST', '/api/purchases', purchaseData);
    if (!response.ok) {
      throw new Error('Failed to add purchase');
    }
    // Optionally refresh any needed data or reset state here
  });
  const handleSubmit = (e: React.FormEvent) => {
    e.preventDefault();
    addPurchase.mutate();
  };
  return (
    <form onSubmit={handleSubmit}>
      {/* Form Fields */}
      <button type="submit">Add Purchase</button>
    </form>
  );
};
export default PurchaseEntryProfessional;
3. Fix Submission Logic
If you're not able to submit or fetch data, review the backend API logic within your server codebase. Confirm that your routes are correctly defined for both adding and retrieving purchase data.

4. Debugging
Use console.log() to debug responses from the server to track where the logic might be failing, such as logging before the API request and after, to inspect both request parameters and response data.
