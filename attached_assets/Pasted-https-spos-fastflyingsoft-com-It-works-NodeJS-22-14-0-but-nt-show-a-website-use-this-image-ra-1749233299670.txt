Thanks for sharing the screenshot — it confirms that your domain (https://spos.fastflyingsoft.com) is running Node.js, but it's only showing:

nginx

Edit
It works!
NodeJS 22.14.0
This is a default placeholder page, meaning your actual app is not deployed or not properly linked to the running Node.js app.

✅ How to Fix: Show Your Website Instead of "It works!"
Follow these steps in your Hostinger hPanel (or cPanel with Node.js support):

🔧 Step 1: Check the Entry File (e.g., index.js, server.js)
Make sure you're pointing to the correct main server file. From your earlier code:

js
Copy
Edit
const express = require('express');
const path = require('path');
const app = express(); // <-- You had this wrong in the previous code

app.use(express.static(path.join(__dirname, 'dist')));

app.get('*', (req, res) => {
  res.sendFile(path.join(__dirname, 'dist', 'index.html'));
});

const PORT = process.env.PORT || 3000;
app.listen(PORT, '0.0.0.0', () => {
  console.log(`POS System running on port ${PORT}`);
});
✅ Step 2: Update Your App in Hostinger
Go to your Node.js App section in Hostinger

In hPanel, find: "Node.js" under "Advanced"

Stop your current app

Set the Application startup file

Example: index.js (make sure it exists in your root folder)

Set the Application root

This is the folder where your index.js or server.js is located

Example: /home/your_user/spos_app

Click "Run"

🔍 Step 3: Upload and Build Frontend
If your project uses React/Vite:

On your local machine, run:

bash
Copy
Edit
npm run build
Upload the contents of the dist/ folder to your project root (or serve from there)

🎯 Step 4: Recheck URL
Now visit https://spos.fastflyingsoft.com. You should see your real site, not the placeholder.

🔁 Summary Checklist
✅ Step	Done?
Correct startup file (e.g., index.js) set in Node.js manager	✅
Uploaded frontend build to dist/ or public/ folder	✅
Express serves index.html from correct folder	✅
Node app restarted in Hostinger	✅

Would you like me to help zip and prepare your dist or full project for deployment? You can upload your project folder or package.json, and I’ll guide you from there.
