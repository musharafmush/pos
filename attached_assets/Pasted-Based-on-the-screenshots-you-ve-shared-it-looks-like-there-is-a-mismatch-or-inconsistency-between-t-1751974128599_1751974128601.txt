Based on the screenshots you've shared, it looks like there is a mismatch or inconsistency between the "Add Item Dashboard" and "Repacking Professional" pricing configurations, specifically with the fields:

Cost Price

Selling Price

MRP

üîç Observed Issues
Field	Add Item Dashboard	Repacking Professional
Cost Price	‚Çπ40	‚Çπ50
Selling Price	‚Çπ50	‚Çπ60
MRP	‚Çπ100	‚Çπ100

‚ùó Problem:
The cost price, selling price, and MRP are not synced between the "Add Item" and "Repacking" modules.

This creates confusion and potential accounting errors.

‚úÖ Suggested Fix
You should read and sync the pricing details from the Add Item Dashboard into the Repacking Professional form automatically when:

A source product is selected.

Repacking is configured.

üõ†Ô∏è Implementation Steps (Developer Notes)
Update the Repacking Professional module:

Fetch Pricing Details (Cost, MRP, Selling Price) from the original product (from Add Item Dashboard) using the selected source product ID.

Pre-fill those values in the pricing configuration form.

Disable manual edits if not allowed, or enable an "Override" option with a toggle.

Example (Pseudocode / JavaScript):
js
Copy
Edit
function fetchProductPricingDetails(productId) {
    // Call your API to get product pricing details
    const product = getProductById(productId);
    
    // Set the values
    document.querySelector("#costPriceInput").value = product.costPrice;
    document.querySelector("#sellingPriceInput").value = product.sellingPrice;
    document.querySelector("#mrpInput").value = product.mrp;
}
Use this during the repack screen load or when the source product is selected.

üß™ Final Check
Once implemented:

Selecting a source product like "Rice Bulk" should auto-fill its cost, selling price, and MRP into the repack screen.

Any manual override (if needed) should be allowed through a checkbox or toggle.

Ensure pricing in both modules matches unless intentionally changed.

Let me know if you‚Äôd like help writing the exact backend or frontend code for this.
