I'll help you implement the Open Register with Sales Dashboard Data Sync feature. Let me create the backend endpoints and enhance the existing cash register dashboard to support the real-time sales tracking.

First, let me add the register management endpoints to the backend:

server/routes.ts
Now let me add the necessary storage methods:

server/storage.ts
Now let me create a comprehensive sales dashboard that integrates with the cash register:

client/src/pages/sales-dashboard.tsx
Now let me add the sales dashboard route to the main App component:

client/src/App.tsx
Now let me add the sales dashboard link to the sidebar:

client/src/components/layout/sidebar.tsx
Finally, let me update the POS Enhanced to integrate with the register system:

client/src/pages/pos-enhanced.tsx
