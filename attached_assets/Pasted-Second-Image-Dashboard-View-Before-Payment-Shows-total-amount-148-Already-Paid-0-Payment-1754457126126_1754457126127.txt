Second Image (Dashboard View - Before Payment):

Shows total amount: ‚Çπ148

Already Paid: ‚Çπ0

Payment Amount input is ‚Çπ148

So far, everything looks correct before making the payment.

First Image (Purchase Detail View - After Payment):

Shows total amount: ‚Çπ148

Amount Paid: ‚Çπ100

Balance Due: ‚Çπ48

Payment Status: Partially Paid

However, the record payment section is still editable with ‚Çπ100 input, which suggests it hasn‚Äôt been finalized.

‚ùå Problem:
After recording the payment (‚Çπ148 or ‚Çπ100), the dashboard view and detailed view are not in sync. Specifically:

In the dashboard, it shows ‚Çπ0 paid even though a payment was made.

In the detail view, it shows partial payment (‚Çπ100), but this does not reflect back in the dashboard.

üîç Possible Causes:
Backend API or DB not updating properly:

The record might be saved in a local state or cache but not persisted to the database.

The API used for updating payment might not be refreshing the dashboard data.

Asynchronous update issue:

Payment recorded successfully, but the dashboard is not refreshed after the transaction.

Missing call to reload the latest data in dashboard after redirection or submission.

Multiple payment entry forms may cause inconsistency if:

The modal (second image) and page view (first image) use different logic or models for saving/updating payments.

‚úÖ Suggested Fixes:
Ensure successful payment API call:

Verify that when the ‚ÄúRecord Payment‚Äù button is clicked, the payment is properly saved and confirmed via API response (e.g., 200 OK).

Add console logging or debugging to confirm payment is saved in DB.

Update dashboard data immediately after payment:

After payment is recorded, call the function or API to refresh dashboard stats.

If you're using a state management library (like Redux, Vuex, etc.), make sure it updates after transaction.

Unify payment logic:

Avoid separate forms/modal windows for the same data unless they share the same backend method.

Ensure both use a shared function or endpoint to update payment records.

Confirm database write-back:

Sometimes, the payment shows on frontend but isn't written to the database. Check for DB update errors silently failing.

üõ† Development Checklist:
 Check console logs / network tab (in DevTools) for failed requests.

 Inspect backend controller or API that saves the payment.

 Add dashboard refresh or re-fetch logic after payment is recorded.

 Validate both partial and full payments update consistently across all views.
